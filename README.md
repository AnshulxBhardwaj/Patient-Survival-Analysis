**Project Context:**
The project aims to analyze a dataset from a healthcare scenario to predict hospital mortality. The dataset contains various patient attributes such as demographics, medical history, vital signs, and outcomes. The prediction of hospital mortality is crucial for healthcare providers to allocate resources efficiently and improve patient care.

**Dataset Description:**
The dataset consists of 85 columns and 91,713 entries, representing patient records. Each row corresponds to a unique patient encounter https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mitishaagarwal/patient . Key features include:

**Demographic Information:** Age, gender, ethnicity, etc.
**Clinical Parameters:** BMI, vital signs (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure), medical history (e.g., diabetes, cirrhosis).
**Hospital and ICU Details:** Hospital ID, ICU type, admission source, etc.
**Outcome Variable:** The target variable 'hospital_death' indicates whether the patient died during the hospital stay (1 for yes, 0 for no).
**Data Preprocessing:**
Missing Values: Several columns have missing values, which were handled using imputation techniques such as mean or median imputation.
Categorical Encoding: Categorical variables were encoded using techniques like one-hot encoding to make them suitable for machine learning algorithms.


**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Univariate Analysis: Analyzed distributions and summary statistics of individual variables.
Bivariate Analysis: Explored relationships between variables, particularly focusing on their correlation with hospital mortality.
Visualization: Used various plots such as histograms, count plots, and heatmaps to visualize data distributions, correlations, and patterns.
Feature Selection: Identified significant features using correlation matrices and domain knowledge.
Model Selection: Experimented with different machine learning models such as logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated models using appropriate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuned hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search to optimize model performance.
Conclusion:
The project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in predicting hospital mortality using patient data. By leveraging advanced analytics techniques, healthcare providers can enhance patient care, allocate resources effectively, and ultimately improve clinical outcomes.
